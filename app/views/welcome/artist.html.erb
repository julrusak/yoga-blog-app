    		I've been in love with the theater as long as I can remember. I used to act out every part of my favorite musicals, for all of my stuffed animals to see. I've performed, directed, designed, and production managed my way through this past decade.

    		Since receiving my MFA from Sarah Lawrence College, I have been interested in experimental work. Work that explores taboo topics, or asks big questions, or doesn't quite make sense. I'm an explorer of the human condition.
